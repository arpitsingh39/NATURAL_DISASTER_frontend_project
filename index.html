    <h1>Natural Disaster</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>A <b>Natural Disaster</b> is a major event caused by the natural processes of the Earth that results in widespread destruction, damage to the environment,
     and often loss of life. These catastrophic events can occur suddenly or develop over time, often harming communities
     and disrupting daily life. Natural disasters include phenomena such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, wildfires, tornadoes,
     volcanic eruptions, blizzards, and droughts. They are generally classified by their cause: geological (like earthquakes and volcanoes), hydrological
     (like floods and tsunamis), meteorological (like cyclones and blizzards), and even space-related events (like meteor impacts). While these disasters
     are triggered by natural forces, human activities such as deforestation and urbanization can sometimes
     contribute to their severity or likelihood. Natural disasters have shaped human history, causing significant loss of life and property; they continue
     to remind us of the power and unpredictability of nature</p>
