           <h3>Volcanic Eruption</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            A volcanic eruption occurs when material is expelled from a volcanic vent or fissure.
            Several types of volcanic eruptions have been distinguished by volcanologists.
            These are often named after famous volcanoes where that type of behavior has been observed.
            Some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption during a period of activity, while others may display an entire sequence of types all in one eruptive series.
            There are three main types of volcanic eruptions. Magmatic eruptions involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatic eruptions are driven by the superheating of steam due to the close proximity of magma. 
            This type exhibits no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock. Phreatomagmatic eruptions are driven by the direct interaction of magma and water, as opposed to phreatic eruptions, where no fresh magma reaches the surface.
            Within these broad eruptive types are several subtypes.

        <h3>Earthquake</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        An earthquake – also called a quake, tremor, or temblor – is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those so weak
         they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes
          experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event that generates
           seismic waves. Earthquakes can occur naturally or be induced by human activities, such as mining, fracking, and nuclear weapons testing. The initial point of rupture is called the hypocenter or focus, while the ground level directly above it is the epicenter.

        <h3>Flood</h3>
        <p>
        A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. It can occur due to various reasons, including:
            <li>Heavy Rainfall – Intense or prolonged rain can overwhelm drainage systems or cause rivers to overflow.</li>
            <li>River Overflow – When rivers exceed their capacity due to excessive rain or snowmelt.</li>
            <li>Dam or Levee Failure – Structural breaches can release large volumes of water suddenly.</li>
            <li>Urbanization – Poor drainage in cities with extensive paved surfaces can lead to flash floods.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 style="font-size:40px;">Types of Floods:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Flash Floods – Sudden, intense flooding, often with little warning.</li>
            <li>River Floods – Gradual rising of rivers due to sustained rainfall or snowmelt.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3> Wild fire</h3>
            <p>
            A wildfire, forest fire, or a bushfire is an unplanned and uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible vegetation. Depending on the type of vegetation present, a wildfire may be more specifically identified as a bushfire (in Australia),
             desert fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, prairie fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Some natural forest ecosystems depend on wildfire. Modern forest management often engages in prescribed burns to mitigate fire risk and promote natural
              forest cycles. However, controlled burns can turn into wildfires by mistake.Wildfires can be classified by cause of ignition, physical properties, combustible material present, and the effect of weather on the fire. Wildfire severity results from
               a combination of factors such as available fuels, physical setting, and weather. Climatic cycles with wet periods that create substantial fuels, followed by drought and heat, often precede severe wildfires. These cycles have been intensified by climate
                change, and can be exacerbated by curtailment of mitigation measures (such as budget or equipment funding), or sheer enormity of the event.

            <h3>Drought</h3>
            <p>
            Drought is a prolonged dry period in the natural climate cycle that can occur anywhere in the world. It is a slow-onset disaster characterized by the lack of precipitation, resulting in a water shortage. Drought can have a serious impact on health, agriculture, economies, energy and the environment.
            An estimated 55 million people globally are affected by droughts every year, and they are the most serious hazard to livestock and crops in nearly every part of the world. Drought threatens people’s livelihoods, increases the risk of disease and death, and fuels mass migration. Water scarcity impacts 40% of the world’s population
            , and as many as 700 million people are at-risk of being displaced as a result of drought by 2030. Rising temperatures caused by climate change are making already dry regions drier and wet regions wetter. In dry regions, this means that when temperatures rise, water evaporates more quickly, and thus increases the risk of drought or 
            prolongs periods of drought. Between 80-90% of all documented disasters from natural hazards during the past 10 years have resulted from floods, droughts, tropical cyclones and heat waves.

            <h3>Storm</h3>
            <p "margin-bottom: 20px;">
            A storm is a period of disturbed weather, typically characterized by strong winds, heavy precipitation (such as rain, snow, or hail), and often accompanied by lightning and thunder. Storms can range in intensity and duration, from brief thundershowers to powerful tropical cyclones or blizzards.
            It can also be defined any disturbed state of the natural environment or the atmosphere of an astronomical body.[citation needed] It may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind, tornadoes, hail, thunder and lightning (a thunderstorm), heavy precipitation (snowstorm, rainstorm), heavy freezing rain (ice storm),
             strong winds (tropical cyclone, windstorm), wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere such as in a dust storm, among other forms of severe weather.Storms have the potential to harm lives and property via storm surge, heavy rain or snow causing flooding or road impassibility, lightning, wildfires, and vertical and horizontal wind shear. 
             Systems with significant rainfall and duration help alleviate drought in places they move through.
